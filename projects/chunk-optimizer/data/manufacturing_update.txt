The manufacturing group consolidated three factories into a leaner network during FY24.
Each facility now follows an identical documentation standard: background, insight, action, and owner.
This structure compresses context yet keeps every decision auditable.

An excerpt from the latest report:
- Background: Foam offcuts increased 12% because of sneaker upper redesigns that rely on thicker panels.
- Insight: Machine logs revealed that cutting programs still use last year's optimal nesting layout.
- Action: Update the CAD scripts and run an A/B test across Batch 6 with live telemetry to watch for drift.
- Owner: Materials engineering + digital twin team.

The process notes stretch to several hundred lines; chunk sizes impact how clearly the telemetry recommendations sync with root causes.
