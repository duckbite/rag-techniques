# rag-techniques

Typescript port of https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques

* uses typescript instead of python
* each subproject has a README.md file explaining how to use it
* instead of one long notebook divide into various scripts / functions per project responsible for a single task or task group (e.g. db initialization, creating embeddings and inserting items in db, read from db, perform analysis, etc.). Make this a logical distribution per project.
* main project has universal functionality (e.g. adapters to datas sources, etc)
