# RAG Techniques Implementation Plan

This document tracks parity work as we port the 34 techniques from [`NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques`](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques) into standalone TypeScript projects. Update this plan whenever scope, sequencing, or owners change.

## Cross-Cutting Tasks

- Document every new project in `docs/product.md` (overview) and update `docs/project-structure.md`.
- Ensure each project stores runtime artifacts under `projects/<name>/.tmp/`.
- Add Vitest coverage per project; extend shared utilities (`shared/typescript`) only when logic is reusable.
- Keep `docs/plan.md` as the single source of truth for sequencing, responsible owner, and blockers.
