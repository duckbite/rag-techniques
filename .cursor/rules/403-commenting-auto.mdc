# Commenting Policy

## Context

- Apply whenever adding/modifying code, during PR reviews, and when documenting edge cases or architectural tradeoffs.
- Use this rule to prevent incomplete markers (e.g. TODOs) and eliminate obvious/noise comments.

## Requirements

- Write comments only when they add non-obvious context: intent, rationale, invariants, constraints, or edge cases.
- Explain “why” over “what.” Code should make the “what” clear.
- Prohibit incomplete work markers (e.g. TODO, FIXME, TBD) in committed code. Implement now or open a tracked issue and reference it.
- Document non-trivial algorithms, performance implications, security considerations, and protocol or API contracts.
- Keep comments concise, up-to-date, and placed near the relevant code. Delete stale comments when code changes.
- Prefer precise terminology; avoid redundancy with names. If a comment repeats the code, remove it or rename identifiers for clarity.
- For public APIs, document inputs, outputs, errors, and side effects where not self-evident.
- Use code comments, not commit messages, to capture local invariants. Use ADRs or architecture docs for system-wide decisions.

## Examples

<example>
Good: Explains rationale and constraints.
// Avoids N^2 by caching lookups; input size can exceed 50k items in prod
// Keys are case-insensitive due to upstream API contract
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Invalid: Obvious or incomplete.
// increment i by 1
// TODO: handle errors
</example>

## Critical Points

<critical>
  - ALWAYS document non-obvious intent, invariants, and tradeoffs.
  - NEVER commit TODO/FIXME/TBD or placeholder comments; replace with code or an issue link.
  - ENSURE comments stay accurate; update or remove when code changes.
</critical>
