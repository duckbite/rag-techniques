# Monorepo Rules (Turborepo + Language-Agnostic Shared Code)

## Goals

- Single monorepo for one project with many deployables (apps, services, workers).
- Language-agnostic structure with shared code under `shared/<language>/*`.
- Fast, incremental builds via Turborepo; consistent DX across languages.
- Strict boundaries: deployables don’t import other deployables; only shared libs.

---

**Enforcement**

- New deployables go under `apps/`, `services/`, or `workers/`.
- Shared code must live inside `shared/…` with a clear, language-specific home.
- Do not create ad-hoc `common/` folders outside `shared/`.

---

## Workspace & Discovery

**pnpm-workspace.yaml**

```yaml
packages:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'services/*'
  - 'workers/*'
  - 'shared/*/*' # e.g., shared/typescript/*, shared/python/*
  - 'tools/*'
```
